## Gene set enrichment analysis

High resolution images obtained from AgriGO for gene set enrichment of differentially expresed genes. Genes from each set with their GO ID can be obtained from the `DEG annotated` folder

Image name codes follow the pattern: `Condition1Condition2 + tissue + geneset`

`Condition1Condition2` refers to which 2 conditions where being contrasted while doing the differential expression analysis (ie: WG means the stages that were being compared were White vs Green)

`tissue` refers to the plant tissue the samples were obtained from

`geneset` refers to the set of genes of each comparison, either up-regulated genes or down-regulated

Thus, the image with the code `WGAup` refers to the gene set enrichment of upregulated genes in achenes between the white and green stages.
